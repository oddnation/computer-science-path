# Computer Science Path

This is my way of learning Computer Science using the roadmap from the [Roadmap.sh](https://roadmap.sh/computer-science) which details a learning path for the self-taught developer.

This will be a pretty large repository, as it will contain about 20 projects which would cover the major points shown in the roadmap. I will document as much of the thinking behind certain decisions as possible, I will also include any learning resources that haven't been included in the original roadmaps learning path.

I take no credit in this roadmap, it was downloaded from [Roadmap.sh](https://roadmap.sh/computer-science) , please head over to their website as they have great roadmaps for a lot of roles within the software development space along with resources attached.
